# hello_world
This is the start of my journey to working for GitHub.

I am a recent maths graduate, who has recently learnt how to code.
I am currently working for schroders as a Data Engineer but ultimatley I want to work in San Fransico. I see working for somewhere like GitHub as a goal of mine and this is the start of that jorney!

I have decided to build a project around football data.
Football is a passion of mine and i aim to build my knowlege of git and python while working on data that im passionate about.
This project is currently open ended and i have no clear objective right now. other than building a progranm that can pull from the api and handle the data it is given. after that once i have the data i will figure out how to use it

Skills i aim to practice:
Firstly how to build repos in a production worthy way.
How to colaborate on projects using git to enable us to do that.
how to interact with an api in a production worthy manner
